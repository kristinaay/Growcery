# Growcery: an app that allows any individual or small business to grow their own produce 
and sell it to the community around them. This app can benefit both those who have lost their
jobs and income due to the pandemic and also those who either want to give back and support
their local community, those who want to social distance instead of fighting lines and crowds
at the supermarket, and those who want fresh, homegrown products.

To solve the problem of: Food deserts, food scarcity, and food waste. These have long since been issues,
but they have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 crisis. There have been shortages and long lines at
grocery stores across the country, while at the same time farmers are being forced to destroy large quantities
of produce simply because of lack of storage and distribution.

How the app helps buyers: 
-Avoid long lines and crowds at the supermarket
-Access to fresh produce that may or may not be in stock at the store
-Help give back and support their community

How the app helps sellers:
-A chance for experienced and new growers to produce their own food
-The money made from selling produce/home baked goods can help ease
the burden slightly for the large amount of people who were unemployed
during this crisis
-The food they grow can become a life long way for them not only to
produce food for sale, but also to produce their own food

How the app helps suppliers:
-We hope suppliers will donate their excess materials 
(things that would be destroyed/go to waste anyways) to this
app, and allow that waste to become a sustainable alternative 
source of food for communities, especially ones with food deserts.

***This app is not fully functional yet, but provides a basic framework
of what the finished product should look like and what it would offer***
